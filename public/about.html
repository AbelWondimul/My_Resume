<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Abel Legesse, a passionate international student studying Computer Science at Pacific Lutheran University.
Originally from Ethiopia, I embarked on this exciting journey to the United States one years ago to pursue my dreams and broaden my horizons.
</p>
<p>As a curious and determined individual, my first year in the US has been nothing short of transformative. Immersed in a new culture and educational system, I embraced every opportunity to grow both academically and personally. The diverse experiences 
  I've had have shaped my perspective, strengthened my resilience, and ignited my passion for technology.</p>
<p>Throughout my studies, I've delved into various programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies. The field of Computer Science has always fascinated me, with its potential to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact. 
  I'm constantly seeking ways to challenge myself, collaborate with peers, and explore emerging technologies.</p>
<p>While academics play a significant role in my life, I believe in the power of a well-rounded education. Beyond the computer screen, I find joy in engaging with my hobbies and interests. When I'm not immersed in coding or attending classes, you can find me hiking along breathtaking trails, capturing moments through my camera lens, or exploring new cuisines.
   These experiences fuel my creativity, inspire me to think differently, and provide a healthy balance in my life.</p>
<p>With a relentless pursuit of excellence, I strive to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects that create meaningful solutions. I am passionate about using technology to make a difference and improve the lives of individuals and communities. The prospect of collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations excites me, 
  as I believe collective efforts lead to the most impactful outcomes.</p>
<p>I am always eager to connect and explore new opportunities. Whether you have a project in mind, want to discuss a collaboration, or simply want to say hello, 
  I would be thrilled to hear from you. Feel free to reach out through the contact information provided below.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. 
  I look forward to connecting and embarking on exciting journeys together!</p>
